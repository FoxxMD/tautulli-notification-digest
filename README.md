# tautuilli-notification-digest

Create "digest" notifications for discord using [Tautulli's](https://tautulli.com/) discord [notification agent](https://github.com/Tautulli/Tautulli/wiki/Notification-Agents-Guide#discord).

## What Does It Do?

Tautulli already provides an email "newsletter" that compiles triggered events (media added) from Plex and then sends it as one email at a set time.

This same functionality **does not exist** for notifications. This [functionality](tautulli newsletter discord) is often requested for [discord](https://www.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/tzadtv/guide_for_setting_up_discord_andor_tautulli/) and there are even some [existing guides](https://forums.serverbuilds.net/t/guide-timed-summary-plex-to-discord-notifications-with-tautulli/4505) but they are quite involved.

**This app provides a drop-in solution for timed notifications that compile all of your "Recently Added" Tautulli events into one notification.**
